      <h1 id="title">The Life of a Student Athlete</h1>
    </header>
    <div <p class="paragraph"> What if your dream school called you and told you they would pay for your school, if you play the sport you've been playing your whole life? I'm sure it sounds like a great deal but, being a Student Athlete is an
      enormous commitment. The amount of hours we put in is nothing like a normal 9am-5pm job, instead its even longer. In my case, my school provides us with an app called "teamworks" which basically provides us with our scehdule each and everyday.
      Lets break this down. </p>

    </div>

    <h2> A daily schedule in a student athletes shoes:</h2>
    <div class="grid-container2">
      <h2 id="Schedule">Schedule:</h2>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>6am-7am lifts </li>
          <li>8am-9:15am class</li>
          <li>9:30am-10:45am class </li>
          <li>11am-12pm lunch </li>
          <li>12pm-1pm therapy </li>
          <li>1:30-2:30 early work</li>
          <li>3pm-6pm practice</li>
          <li>7pm-9pm study hall</li>
          <li>9pm-11pm homework</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Social Life</h2>
      <div <p class="paragraph"> The social life as a student-athlete can sometimes be tough. You dont have time to go out on the weekdays, because we have early morning lifts. We cant join a fraternity because our schedule doesn't allow us too.
        Basically, coming in, its you and your 32 brothers you go to work with everyday. Once the semesters go along, you start to grow your network, but the social life as an athlete is definetly harder than a normal student that doesn't play
        sports.</p>

      </div>


      <h2>Travel life</h2>
      <div <p class="paragraph"> Being a student athlete does come with its pros and cons. While going to school and trying to earn an education from the University of Miami, we also get to fly private on our away trips when we go compete. I've been
        lucky enough to have traveled to many different states and compete around the country. Although traveling and competing is a blast, you spend a lot of time away from home while college students are at home during break. As as baseball player,
        after christmas break, we dont get to go home until our season is over, which is sometime in june, way after school has already ended. </p>

      </div>

      <h2> Baseball life </h2>
      <div <p class="paragraph"> Although being a Student-athlete can be a grind. I wouldn't change it for the world. You go to work with these 32 guys each and everyday, for almost the whole year. You get free gear along the way that your school is
        sponsored by which ours is adidas. Once playoff season comes around, you are tired, but your adreneline is rushing and you're ready to go because this is what you've worked for all year and it comes down to playoff season. You want to be the
        best team in the country at the end of the season. </p>

      </div>


      <h2>Life lessons</h2>
      <div <p class="paragraph"> The life lessons that college and the student athlete life has taught me is something I will forever be grateful for. There are things I do in my everyday life that baseball has taught me such as, being a good
        teamplayer, being on time, being accountable for your actions, dealing with failure, how to respond to situations if they dont go your way, and the list goes on. I have been playing this game ever since I was a kid and I will forever be
        indebted into this game that has taught me so much. </p>
